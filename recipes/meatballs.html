    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meatball" 
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meatballs</strong></a>
        are ground meat (minced) rolled into a ball, sometimes along 
        with other ingredients, such as bread crumbs, minced onion, eggs, 
        butter, and seasoning.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground meat: This meatball recipe uses a blend of ground beef, 
            ground veal, and ground pork. You can switch it up depending on 
            what you have on hand.</li>
        <li>Seasonings and herbs: fresh garlic, fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley,
            and ground black 
            pepper.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Eggs keep the meatballs from drying out and they act as a 
            binding agent, which means they help hold the ingredients 
            together.</li>
        <li>Cheese: 1 cup of freshly grated Romano cheese. If you can, avoid 
            the pre-grated stuff for this recipe.</li>
        <li>Italian bread: Slightly stale Italian bread is preferable. 
            If your bread feels soft, try letting it sit out overnight.</li>
        <li>Water or Milk</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
